This repository contains:
- ```Exercise_1.ipynb```: a notebook that contains the first exercise, in which we have implemented our Shazam;
- ```Question_2+Algo_question.ipynb```: a notebook that contains the second exercise "Grouping songs together" and the algorithmic question;

Dataset used:
1) For the first exercise we use this  [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/dhrumil140396/mp3s32k) from Kaggle, converting the songs from .mp3 to .wav format. We apply our implementation of shazam to this query songs
